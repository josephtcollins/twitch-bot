## Overview

An automated [Twitch](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc) chat bot console application that runs from a command line interface (CLI).

## How It Works

TBW

## Development

### Requirements

The bot application should be able to:

- [ ] Console output all interactions - legibly formatted, with timestamps.
- [ ] Connect to Twitch IRC over SSL.
- [ ] Join a channel.
- [ ] Read a channel.
- [ ] Read a private message.
- [ ] Write to a channel
- [ ] Reply to a private message.
- [ ] Avoid premature disconnections by handling Twitch courier ping / pong requests.
- [ ] Publicly reply to a user-issued string command within a channel (!YOUR_COMMAND_NAME).
- [ ] Reply to the "!chucknorris" command by dynamically returning a random fact about Chuck Norris using the [Chuck Norris API](https://api.chucknorris.io).

### Qualities

- [ ] All interactions in this project are asynchronous.
- [ ] The application accounts for Twitch API rate limits.
- [ ] The application does not exit prematurely.
- [ ] The project is appropriately documented.
- [ ] The project has 100% test coverage.
